Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **kotlin.String** | The network&#39;s name. | 
**checkDuplicate** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Check for networks with duplicate names. Since Network is primarily keyed based on a random ID and not on the name, and network name is strictly a user-friendly alias to the network which is uniquely identified using ID, there is no guaranteed way to check for duplicates. CheckDuplicate is there to provide a best effort checking of any networks which has the same name but it is not guaranteed to catch all name collisions.  |  [optional]
